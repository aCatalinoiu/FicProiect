I've just received my ESP-07, it is the 16 pin version with blue led always on.
I was able to flash it easily by connecting 
CODE: SELECT ALL
GPIO15 to GND
CH_PD to VCC
GPI0 to GND


What I did is adding a button to connect the GPI0 to GND, when I want to flash it i remove the FTDI and press on the button then put back the FTDI cable then stop pressing on the button.

What I've noticed is if you are on the flash mode the FTDI led will not blink but if you are on normal mode it will blink fast.


soldered the 4th module, just in case this problem of mine can be caused by floating pins, i only soldered tx rx gpio15 gnd vcc and ch_pd.. I know that there is a workin at firmware on them but.. nothing... just nothing again.. :/ gonna try to trace the pin wire and try to find if something is wrong with whole lot/delivery...
